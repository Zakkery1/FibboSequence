# Fibonacci Sequence
This sequence is where if we start at 0, and 1, we add these two numbers together to equal 1. 
We then take the newly added number and add the previous number (1), and add them together.
0+1 = 1
1+1 = 2
2+1 = 3
3+2 = 5

# Loop and Recursion Model
Looping through the Fibonacci Sequence would just mean iterating through until a condition is met.
Recursion would be a function or method calling itself until a condition is met.

# The Big O Notation for this algorithm and how you arrive at that conclusion
using the recursion model of the fibinacci sequence would be O(n) because it has a fixed number of recursive calls.
